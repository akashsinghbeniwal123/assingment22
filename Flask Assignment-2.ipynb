    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "Ans:Templates in Flask are HTML files that contain placeholders for dynamic content. These placeholders are replaced with actual values when the template is rendered. This allows you to separate the structure and layout of your web pages from the application logic, making your code more organized and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
