    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread is a separate flow of control within the process, sharing the same memory space. This can improve performance by allowing tasks to be executed simultaneously, especially in CPU-bound operations.\n",

    "1.Improved performance: By executing multiple tasks concurrently, you can make better use of your CPU's resources and potentially speed up your program.\n",

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "Ans:Advantages of Multithreading\n",
    "Improved Performance: Multithreading can significantly enhance performance, especially for CPU-bound tasks. By dividing a task into smaller subtasks that can be executed concurrently, you can make better use of your CPU's resources.\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can help prevent your application from freezing while performing long-running tasks. For example, in a GUI application, a separate thread can handle background tasks like loading data or processing images, allowing the main thread to keep the user interface responsive.\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading is essential for handling concurrent tasks, such as network I/O or database operations. It allows your application to handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving its scalability and responsiveness.\n",
    "Modularity: By breaking down a complex task into smaller, independent threads, you can improve the modularity and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can introduce complexity into your code, making it harder to write, debug, and maintain. You need to be careful to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, and other synchronization issues.\n",
    "Overhead: Creating and managing threads can incur some overhead, especially for small tasks. This overhead can sometimes outweigh the benefits of multithreading.\n",
    "Synchronization Issues: Coordinating the execution of multiple threads can be challenging. You need to use synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and events to prevent race conditions and ensure that shared resources are accessed in a safe manner.\n",
    "Debugging Challenges: Debugging multithreaded applications can be difficult, as the timing of events can affect the behavior of your program. You may need to use specialized tools or techniques to identify and fix issues related to thread synchronization and race conditions."
