    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an\n",
    "example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "Ans:Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the appropriate statistical techniques that can be used and the meaningful interpretations that can be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a survey asking participants to rate their satisfaction with a product on a scale of 1 to 5. This data is measured at an ordinal level, as the categories (1-5) have a clear order but the differences between them are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to calculate the mean satisfaction rating, you would be treating the data as if it were measured at an interval or ratio level, which would be incorrect. The mean would not have a meaningful interpretation, as the differences between the categories are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, appropriate statistical techniques for ordinal data, such as mode or median, should be used. These measures provide a more accurate and meaningful representation of the satisfaction ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, understanding the level of measurement helps to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select appropriate statistical techniques: Different levels of measurement require different statistical analyses.\n",
    "Interpret results accurately: Misinterpreting the level of measurement can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mean: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.\n",
    "Use: Provides the average value of the dataset. Useful when data is normally distributed and there are no outliers.\n",
    "Median: The middle value in a dataset when arranged in order.\n",
    "Use: Represents the 50th percentile of the data. Less sensitive to outliers than the mean.\n",
    "Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.\n",
    "Use: Indicates the most common value in the data. Can be used for both quantitative and qualitative data.\n",
    "Variability refers to how spread out the data is. Common measures of variability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "Use: A simple measure of spread, but sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "Variance: The average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "Use: A measure of how much the data points vary from the mean.\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance.\n",
    "Use: A commonly used measure of spread, expressed in the same units as the data.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following dataset: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n",
