    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans:An ensemble technique in machine learning is a powerful approach that combines multiple models to improve predictive performance. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble methods leverage the collective wisdom of several models to make more accurate and robust predictions. This approach is inspired by the idea that a group of experts can often make better decisions than a single expert.   \n",

    "Base Models: These are the individual models that are combined within the ensemble. They can be of various types, such as decision trees, neural networks, or support vector machines.   \n",

    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "Ans:Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons:   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Accuracy:   \n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Variance: Ensemble methods can reduce the variance of predictions by combining multiple models. This means that the predictions are less sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the training data.   \n",
    "Reduced Bias: By combining models with different biases, ensemble methods can reduce the overall bias of the prediction.   \n",
    "Increased Generalization: Ensemble methods can improve the generalization ability of models, making them more accurate on unseen data.   \n",
    "2. Increased Robustness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: Ensemble methods can help prevent overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple models. This can lead to more stable and reliable models.   \n",
    "Improved Handling of Noisy Data: Ensemble methods can be more robust to noisy data, as the combined predictions of multiple models can help to mitigate the impact of outliers and errors.   \n",
    "3. Enhanced Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance: Some ensemble methods, such as random forests, can provide insights into the importance of different features in the data. This can help to identify the most relevant features for making predictions.   \n",
    "4. Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Diverse Model Combinations: Ensemble methods can combine a wide range of different models, including decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. This flexibility allows for the creation of powerful and versatile models."
