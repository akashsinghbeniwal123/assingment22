    "Ans:C) Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science that aims to create intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. In essence, AI seeks to mimic human intelligence and problem-solving abilities.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A self-driving car uses AI to perceive its surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely. It employs algorithms to recognize objects like pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles, and then determines the best course of action to avoid accidents and reach its destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A spam filter uses ML to learn from labeled emails (spam and non-spam) and identify characteristics that distinguish spam from legitimate messages. It can then use this knowledge to filter incoming emails and automatically classify them as spam or non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "E) Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from data. These neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain and can handle large amounts of data and complex tasks.\n",
