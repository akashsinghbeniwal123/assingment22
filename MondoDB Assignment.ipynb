    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans:MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, which stands for \"Not Only SQL.\" Unlike traditional relational databases (RDBMS) that use tables and rows to store data, MongoDB stores data in a flexible document-oriented format. This means that each document can have different fields and structures, making it more adaptable to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases in short:Non-relational databases are designed to handle large datasets and complex data structures that are not easily represented in a relational format. They often use key-value pairs, document-oriented, graph, or wide-column storage models. \n",
    "\n",
    "scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB:\n",
    "Unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "1.Document-oriented storage: MongoDB stores data in flexible documents, which can have different fields and structures. This makes it easy to model complex data structures and handle changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Dynamic schema: Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema. This means that you can add or remove fields from documents without having to modify the database structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing on any field, including nested fields. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data analysis and reporting tasks. Â  \n",
    "\n",
    "5.Geospatial queries: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data types and indexing, making it ideal for applications that deal with location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Full-text search: MongoDB supports full-text search, allowing you to search for text within documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Replication and sharding: MongoDB provides replication and sharding mechanisms for high availability and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.ACID compliance: MongoDB supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Integration with programming languages: MongoDB has drivers for most popular programming languages, making it easy to integrate into your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Community and ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active community and ecosystem, providing a wealth of resources, tools, and support."
