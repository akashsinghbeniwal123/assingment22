    "Ans:Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "PMF and PDF are two fundamental concepts in probability theory used to describe the distribution of random variables. They differ based on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "Used for discrete random variables: A discrete random variable can take on a countable number of values.\n",
    "Defines the probability of each value: The PMF gives the probability that a discrete random variable will take on a specific value.\n",
    "Sum of probabilities: The sum of the PMF values for all possible values of the random variable must equal 1.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a coin toss experiment. The random variable X representing the number of heads can take on values 0 or 1. The PMF for X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 0) = 0.5 (probability of getting no heads)\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 0.5 (probability of getting one head)\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "Used for continuous random variables: A continuous random variable can take on any value within a continuous range.\n",
    "Defines the relative likelihood of values: The PDF does not give the exact probability of a specific value (as it's zero for continuous variables), but rather the relative likelihood of the variable being near that value.\n",
    "Integral of PDF: The integral of the PDF over its entire domain must equal 1.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the height of people in a population. The height is a continuous random variable. The PDF would give the relative likelihood of a person's height being close to a specific value, such as 5 feet 10 inches."

    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "Ans:CDF is a function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. It's a non-decreasing function that starts at 0 and approaches 1 as the value of the random variable increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable X representing the time it takes to finish a task. The CDF of X, denoted as F(x), would give the probability that the task is completed in less than or equal to x units of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why CDF is Used:\n",
    "Probability calculations: CDFs are used to calculate probabilities for various ranges of values. For instance, to find the probability that the task is completed between 30 and 60 minutes, we can calculate F(60) - F(30).\n",
    "Quantile calculations: CDFs help in finding quantiles or percentiles of a distribution. For example, to find the 75th percentile of the task completion time, we need to find the value x such that F(x) = 0.75.\n",
    "Distribution comparison: CDFs can be used to compare different probability distributions. If two distributions have the same CDF, they are identical.\n",
    "Statistical analysis: CDFs are used in various statistical analyses, such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction.\n"
