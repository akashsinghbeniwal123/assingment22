    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in\n",

    "Ans:Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression models rely on several key assumptions to ensure accurate and reliable results. These assumptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables should be linear. This can be checked visually using scatter plots or by examining the residual plots.\n",
    "Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. This means that the error in one observation should not influence the error in another observation.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all values of the independent variable. This can be checked using residual plots.\n",
    "Normality of Errors: The errors should be normally distributed. This can be checked using histograms, Q-Q plots, or statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n",
    "No Multicollinearity: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can lead to unstable estimates and difficulty in interpreting the model.   \n",
    "Checking Assumptions\n",
    "To check these assumptions, we can use various statistical techniques and visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plots: Visualize the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "Residual Plots: Plot the residuals against the predicted values. If the relationship is linear, the residuals should be randomly scattered around zero.\n",
    "Independence of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Durbin-Watson Test: This statistical test can be used to check for autocorrelation in the residuals.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity:\n",

    "Residual Plots: Check for patterns in the residuals. If the variance of the residuals is constant, they should be evenly spread out.\n",

    "Intercept (50000): This means that even if a house has zero square footage (which is unrealistic), its predicted price would be $50,000. This could represent a base price for a plot of land or other fixed costs associated with owning a house.\n",
    "Slope (100): This means that for every additional square foot of the house, the price increases by $100. So, if a house is 100 square feet larger, its predicted price would be $10,000 higher."
