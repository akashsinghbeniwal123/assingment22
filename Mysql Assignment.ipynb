    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Database:\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data, organized in a way that allows efficient retrieval and management.\n",
    " It serves as a central repository for information, enabling users to store, access, update, and analyze data\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "Relational: Data is organized in tables with rows and columns, forming relationships between data elements.   \n",
    "Schema-driven: A predefined schema defines the structure of the data, including data types and relationships.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational: Data is stored in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.   \n",
    "Schema-less or flexible: Allows for dynamic data structures and changes without altering the schema.\n",
