    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",
    "represent?\n",
    "Ans:R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. In simpler terms, it tells us how well the regression line fits the data points.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "R² is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² = 1 - (SSR/SST)\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "SSR (Sum of Squared Residuals): The sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "SST (Total Sum of Squares): The sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the actual values.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² ranges from 0 to 1:\n",
    "R² = 0: The model explains none of the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "R² = 1: The model explains all of the variability in the dependent variable.   \n",
    "Higher R² values generally indicate a better fit, but it is important to consider other factors like the model complexity and the context of the data.\n",
    "Limitations of R²:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² can increase with the addition of more independent variables, even if they are not significant. This can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "R² doesnot indicate the causal relationship between variables. It only measures the strength of the linear association.\n",
    "R² can be misleading in certain cases, especially when the model is not a good fit for the data."

    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared.\n",

This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and performs poorly on new data.   \n",

    "\n",
    "When you have multiple regression models with varying numbers of independent variables, adjusted R-squared helps you compare their performance more accurately.   \n",
    "It penalizes models with unnecessary predictors, making it easier to identify the model that provides the best balance between fit and complexity.   \n",
    "Preventing Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.   \n",
    "Adjusted R-squared discourages the inclusion of irrelevant predictors that might improve the model fit on the training data but harm its generalization ability.   \n",
    "Assessing the Impact of Adding More Predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are considering adding more independent variables to your model, adjusted R-squared can help you determine whether the additional variables truly improve the model's predictive power.   \n",
    "If the adjusted R-squared decreases after adding a new predictor, it suggests that the new variable is not contributing significantly to the model's performance and might be detrimental."

    "yi is the actual value\n",
    "ŷi is the predicted value\n",

    "  MSE calculates the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. A lower MSE indicates a better-fitting model. However, due to the squaring operation, it can be sensitive to outliers.   \n",

    "2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE = sqrt(MSE)\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "  RMSE is the square root of MSE. It provides a more interpretable measure of error as it is in the same units as the dependent variable. A lower RMSE indicates a better-fitting model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE = (1/n) * Σ|yi - ŷi|\n",

    "Interpretable: The unit of MAE is the same as the target variable.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",

    "Not differentiable at zero: This can make it challenging to use in some optimization algorithms.\n",
    "Choosing the Right Metric:\n",

    "Sensitivity to outliers: If your data contains outliers, MAE is a more robust choice.\n",
    "Penalizing large errors: If large errors are particularly costly, MSE or RMSE might be more appropriate.\n",
    "Interpretability: If you need a metric that is easy to understand, RMSE or MAE are good options.\n",
    "Optimization: If you're using gradient-based optimization, MSE is a common choice due to its differentiability."
