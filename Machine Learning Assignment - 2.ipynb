    "Ans:Reducing Overfitting in Machine Learning\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model becomes overly complex and learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on new, unseen data. Here are some effective strategies to mitigate overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization:\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso): Adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages sparsity, meaning many model parameters become zero, leading to simpler models.\n",

    "Monitor the models performance on a validation set during training.\n",
    "Stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to deteriorate, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.   \n",
    "3. Data Augmentation:\n",
    "Create additional training data by transforming existing data (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to expose the model to different variations of the same data.\n",
    "This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "4. Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "Combine multiple models (e.g., random forests, boosting) to reduce overfitting.\n",
