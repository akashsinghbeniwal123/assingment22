    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "Ans:Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that resembles a flowchart, where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. It operates on a top-down, recursive divide-and-conquer approach to build a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.   \n",

    "\n",

    "The best attribute is chosen based on a metric like information gain, Gini impurity, or entropy.\n",
    "These metrics measure the homogeneity of the data within a node.\n",
    "Splitting the Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best attribute is selected, the dataset is split into subsets based on the values of that attribute.\n",
    "Each subset becomes a child node of the root node.\n",
    "Recursive Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated recursively for each subset, creating new internal nodes or leaf nodes.\n",
    "The algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as:\n",
    "All instances in a node belong to the same class.\n",
    "A predefined maximum depth is reached.\n",
    "A minimum number of instances per node is reached.\n",
    "Making Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction for a new instance, the algorithm starts at the root node and follows the branches based on the values of the attributes of the new instance.\n",
